# RTOS

To create an RTOS-based firmware project in C++ for an embedded system targeting ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, we'll focus on implementing a basic task scheduler using a cooperative multitasking approach. We'll simulate tasks with simple functions and demonstrate task scheduling and context switching. For this example, we'll use the ARM CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) framework for hardware abstraction.

RTOS-based Firmware Project with Tasks for ARM Cortex-M
Requirements
ARM Cortex-M development board (e.g., STM32 Discovery board)
ARM toolchain (e.g., GNU ARM Toolchain)
ARM CMSIS library for Cortex-M microcontrollers
Code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., VS Code, Keil ÂµVision)
